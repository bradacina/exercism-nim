# Raindrops

Convert a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the number's factors.

- If the number has 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
- If the number has 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
- If the number has 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
- If the number does not have 3, 5, or 7 as a factor,
  just pass the number's digits straight through.

## Examples

- 28's factors are 1, 2, 4, **7**, 14, 28.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
- 30's factors are 1, 2, **3**, **5**, 6, 10, 15, 30.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
- 34 has four factors: 1, 2, 17, and 34.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be "34".

## Running the tests

To compile and run the tests, just run the following in your exercise directory:
```bash
$ nim c -r raindrops_test.nim
```
